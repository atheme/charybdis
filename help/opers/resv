RESV [time] <channel|nick> :<reason> [| oper reason]

Reserves a channel or nickname from use.  If [time] is not specified this 
is added to the database, otherwise is temporary for [time] minutes.

If an oper reason is added (the pipe must be specified
to seperate the fields) it will not be shown to the user
when they are given the resv reason.

Nick resvs accept the same wildcard chars as xlines.
Channel resvs only use exact string comparisons.

RESV [time] <channel|nick> ON <server> :<reason>

Will attempt to set the RESV on <server> if <server> accepts remote RESVs.
