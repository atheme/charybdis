Ophion is a fork of charybdis adding partial IRCX support by its
original author which is serving as a temporary ircd until a
better one can be written in Elixir.  Its development is fueled
by a lack of anything better to do on weekends now that Live PD
(and its related drinking game) are cancelled.

Original charybdis credits below:

Charybdis started as an evolution from ircd-ratbox. Its development
is led by a team of dedicated developers who have put a lot of time
into the project and it has seen use on a variety of different
network configurations.
