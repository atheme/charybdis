# Ophion

Ophion is a chat service for communities and teams, combining:

 * a websocket-first IRC server forked from charybdis,
 * implementing IRCv3.2 and some parts of the IRCv3 living standard,
 * and some relevant patent unencumbered parts of IRCX,
 * combined with a new, written from scratch IRCv3 identity service element,
 * and various web services to enhance the IRC environment (and discovery glue for them) and
 * best experienced with an Ophion-enabled web client.

Not all of these components yet exist.  Please be patient.
