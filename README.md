# charybdis

Charybdis was an IRCv3 server designed to be highly scalable.  It implements IRCv3.1 and some parts of IRCv3.2.

It was meant to be used with an IRCv3-capable services implementation such as [Atheme][atheme] or [Anope][anope].

   [anope]: http://www.anope.org/

It is no longer maintained due to the scope of refactoring needed to support modern IRCv3 features.

These days, you should use [Solanum][solanum] instead.  For almost all real-world deployments of Charybdis,
it is better.
